/**
 * Return an anonymized email address.
 *
 * While WP Core supports anonymizing email addresses with the wp_privacy_anonymize_data function,
 * it turns every email address into deleted@site.invalid, which does not work when some purchase/customer records
 * are still needed for legal and regulatory reasons.
 *
 * This function will anonymize the email with an MD5 that is salted
 * and given a randomized uniqid prefixed with the store URL in order to prevent connecting a single customer across
 * multiple stores, as well as the timestamp at the time of anonymization (so it trying the same email again will not be
 * repeatable and therefore connected), and return the email address as <hash>@site.invalid.
 *
 * Taken from Easy Digital Downloads.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 *
 * @param string $email_address

 * @return string
